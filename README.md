# bougietodoapp
Bougie To-Do List App – Description  This isn’t your average to-do list. It’s a luxury productivity experience designed for those who value aesthetics as much as efficiency. With a sleek minimalist interface, fluid animations, and premium typography, every task feels like an event worth celebrating. Which i made in my learning journey of react 
Got it 🌸 Since this is for **GitHub**, we’ll keep it **clean, professional, and polished** — but still with a subtle bougie/girlish touch so it reflects *your personality + skills*. Recruiters will see both your **React learnings** and your **design sense**.

Here’s a **GitHub-ready README.md** draft:

* Use **`useState`** for managing tasks and form input
* Use **`useEffect`** for handling side effects and updates
* Build **multi-page routing** with React Router
* Structure a React project with reusable components
* Apply design thinking to build an **aesthetic UI**
